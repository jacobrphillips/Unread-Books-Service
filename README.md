## Instructions

### How to Request Data

To request data from the microservice, you can use HTTP GET requests. Hereâ€™s how you can do it in Python using the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

# View all unread books
response = requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:5000/view-unread-books")
print(response.json())

# View unread books by author
author = "George Orwell"
response = requests.get(f"http://127.0.0.1:5000/view-unread-books-by-author?author={author}")
print(response.json())
```

### How to Receive Data

The response from the microservice will be in JSON format. To handle this in Python:

```python
import requests

# Example: View all unread books
response = requests.get("http://127.0.0.1:5000/view-unread-books")
if response.status_code == 200:
    unread_books = response.json()
    for book in unread_books:
        print(f"Title: {book['title']}, Author: {book['author']}")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data.")

# Example: View unread books by author
author = "George Orwell"
response = requests.get(f"http://127.0.0.1:5000/view-unread-books-by-author?author={author}")
if response.status_code == 200:
    unread_books_by_author = response.json()
    for book in unread_books_by_author:
        print(f"Title: {book['title']}, Author: {book['author']}")
else:
    print("Failed to retrieve data.")
```
